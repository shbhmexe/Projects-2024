##  🚀  Getting Started
To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lms.git
   cd lms
   ```
2. Install Tailwind CSS: If you haven't already installed Tailwind CSS, you can do so using npm. Run the following command:
   ```bash
      npm install -D tailwindcss
   ```
3. After installing, you need to initialize Tailwind CSS. Run:
   ```
   npx tailwindcss init
    ```
**This will create a tailwind.config.js file in your project.**

4. Create a Tailwind CSS file: Create a CSS file (e.g., styles.css) and add the following lines to include Tailwind's base, components, and utilities:
   ```
   @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
   ```
5.Build Tailwind CSS: You can use the Tailwind CLI to build your CSS file. Run:
   ```
   npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
   ```
- **This command tells Tailwind to take your input CSS file, process it, and output a file (e.g., output.css) that includes all the necessary styles.**
