# 💻 Hacking Terminal Simulator

A fun and interactive **Hacking Terminal Simulator** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, designed to simulate a hacking terminal with a matrix-style background animation. The project is purely front-end and mimics the look and feel of a classic terminal.

## 🔥 Features
- **Matrix Background Animation**: The background has a matrix-like cascading effect, giving the terminal a hacker vibe.
- **Terminal-Style Interface**: Simulated terminal output with fake commands and hacking messages.
- **Dynamic Text**: Randomized text animations to simulate hacking progress.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the terminal and background.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for matrix animation and terminal UI.
- **JavaScript**: Controls the text animations and simulated commands.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The matrix effect is created using CSS animations.
2. JavaScript randomizes the text and simulates command execution.
3. Customize the messages to display in the terminal for added realism.
