# ðŸš€ **WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS - 2024**

In **2024**, Iâ€™ve focused on enhancing my web development skills by working on several projects, all of which are available in my **GitHub repositories**. These include:

- **UI Clones**
- **Full-Stack Applications**
- **Front-End Projects**
- **Back-End Projects**

## ðŸ”‘ Key Projects
One of my key projects is a **Twitter UI Clone**, built using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project helped me deepen my understanding of **responsive design** and **front-end development** principles.

Iâ€™ve also developed several **full-stack projects**, integrating both **front-end** and **back-end** technologies. These hands-on experiences have been crucial in improving my skills in building **clean**, **efficient**, and **user-friendly** web applications.

Feel free to explore my repositories to check out these projects and more!
