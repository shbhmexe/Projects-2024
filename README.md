I created a Twitter UI clone using HTML and TailwindCSS, focusing on replicating the sleek and modern design of the platform. TailwindCSS made it easy to implement responsive layouts, clean typography, and consistent spacing without writing much custom CSS. I meticulously recreated elements like the navbar, sidebar, tweet feed, and profile sections, ensuring the design looked similar to the real platform while also being responsive across different devices. This project helped me improve my front-end skills and deepen my understanding of how TailwindCSS can be used for rapid UI development.
