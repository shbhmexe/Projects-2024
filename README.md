# 🚀 **WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS - 2024**

In **`2024`**, I've focused on enhancing my **`Web Development`** skills by working on several projects, all of which are available in my **GitHub repositories**. These include:

- **`UI Clones`**
- **`Full-Stack Projects`**
- **`Front-End Projects`**
- **`Back-End Projects`**

Here's an enhanced paragraph with the deployment link added seamlessly :

## 🔑 Key Project
One of my key projects is a `Twitter UI` Clone, built using `HTML` and `Tailwind CSS`. This project helped me deepen my understanding of `responsive design` and front-end development principles. You can explore the fully deployed project in inside the every project to see it in action.

I've also developed several **`full-stack projects`**, integrating both **`front-end`** and **back-end** technologies. These hands-on experiences have been crucial in improving my skills in building **`clean`**, **`efficient`**, and **user-friendly** web applications.

**Feel free to explore my repositories to check out these projects and more !**
