In 2024, I’ve focused on enhancing my web development skills by working on several projects, which I’ve uploaded to my GitHub repositories. These include UI clones, full-stack applications, and both front-end and back-end projects. One of my key projects is a Twitter UI clone, built using HTML and Tailwind CSS, which helped me deepen my understanding of responsive design. I’ve also developed full-stack projects, integrating both front-end and back-end technologies. These hands-on experiences have been crucial in improving my ability to build clean, efficient, and user-friendly web applications. Feel free to check out my repositories for more!
