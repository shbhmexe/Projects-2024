# 🚀 **WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS - 2024**

In **`2024`**, I’ve focused on enhancing my **`Web Development`** skills by working on several projects, all of which are available in my **GitHub repositories**. These include:

- **UI Clones**
- **Full-Stack Projects**
- **Front-End Projects**
- **Back-End Projects**


Here's an enhanced paragraph with the deployment link added seamlessly :

## 🔑 Key Project
One of my key projects is a `Twitter UI` Clone, built using `HTML` and `Tailwind CSS`. This project helped me deepen my understanding of `responsive design` and front-end development principles. You can explore the fully deployed project in inside the every project to see it in action.

I’ve also developed several **full-stack projects**, integrating both **front-end** and **back-end** technologies. These hands-on experiences have been crucial in improving my skills in building **clean**, **efficient**, and **user-friendly** web applications.
